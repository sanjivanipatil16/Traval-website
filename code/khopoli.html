                             Imagica theme park is worth a visit and is amongst one of the best in India. 
                             The rides are not the only fun part. There are many shows that happen in the amusement park at various time slots, that keep the visitors entertained.

                                    Tiger’s leap provides a picturesque view of the Western Ghats. The best time to visit the valley would be during either sunset or sunrise. 
                                    Then the skies would be coloured by the rays of the sun. The ombre of reds, oranges and yellow would colour the sky and provide a stark contrast to the green that lay below them.
                                     The sun peeking from behind the mountains would paint the whole area red. This beautiful sight should not be missed.

                                    The fort stands as a marker of the Maratha pride and velour. The area that was once the stronghold of the Martha empire now showcases that strength in the legacy that was left behind. The fort is an architectural marvel and would leave you awestruck. The area is often visited by trekkers and cyclist. The steep uphill drive makes the place a challenge that is worth conquering. The beautiful fort at the top makes the effort worthwhile. Rajmachi fort also presents a beautiful view of the surrounding area.

Though Khopoli was made famous by Imagica amusement park, the sprawling natural beauty is hard to miss. Anyone visiting the place can see the abundance that mother nature has bestowed here. Lonavala and Khandala that lie in close proximity to the area are well known, leaving this place still untouched by throngs of tourists. Thus, the hill station is a getaway from the bustling cities that neighbor the area.
