                                    It’s finally here and now you can travel with your family to a whole new part of the galaxy. We really mean that too because the planet you’ll visit is brand new to the Star Wars story. But don’t worry, you can still meet Rey or you could even encounter the wicked Kylo Ren. Disney has designed Galaxy’s Edge to be completely immersive and it certainly feels like you are in a whole other world. You’ll get the chance to create your own lightsaber and go on a smuggler’s run in the Millenium Falcon. In early 2020, a new attraction, Rise of the Resistance, will also be open that will allow you to fight with the resistance against the First Order.

Journey into space on this roller coaster in the dark as you race around twists and turns with the stars around you. A fun fact about this coaster is that during the Halloween season it becomes Ghost Galaxy! It’s truly a roller coaster in the dark that will have you screaming for more!

                                    Splash Mountain is one of the tallest log flume water rides in the world and there is definitely the opportunity to get wet here. It’s a great way to cool off if the Cali sun is getting to be a little too much that’s for sure. However, it’s the theming that makes this ride a stand out feature. As you journey into the mountain, you’ll discover Br’er Rabbit and his friends as they try and work their way out of trouble. The ride ends with a huge 15-meter drop and what is sure to be a great photo of you screaming!

                                    Finally, the ride deemed too scary for youngsters was shut down at Disney World Florida, but it still has a home here in California. This is a classic and always brings in the crowds. It’s one of the reasons why some people favor Disneyland over Disney World. Is it as scary as some people say? For little ones, this family ride might be a tad too much. Thematically it is quite dark particularly towards the end however it’s a great deal of fun and certainly lives up to the name. This is also one of the only rides that opened with the park in 1955 and is still operational today.
