    <p><a><u>A Guide to Visiting the Kremlin, Moscow</u> </a><br><br>
        <font size="4"><b>
        With its cultural and historical significance, it is little wonder the Kremlin is one of the most visited sights
        in Moscow. This UNESCO World Heritage sight has long been the centre-point for Russia’s most defining historical
        and political events, making it a must-visit stop for those interested in Russia’s long history and future.
        Visiting the architectural complex and all of the sights inside can be a minefield of sorts, with so much to see
        and do! For those interested in maximising their experience, here is your ultimate guide to visiting the
        Kremlin, including all of the must-know information and the great sights inside the Kremlin walls!</p></b></font>

                <font size="4" align="left"><b>There are two entrances to the Kremlin, however neither of these are accessible from Red Square. The
                main entrance is located through the Kutafya tower and is where most visitors queue to enter. The second
                entrance is much less used, however can be found through the Alexandrovsky gardens. This second entrance
                is the quickest entrance to the Armoury chamber and the Diamond Fund.

                As the Kremlin is at the top of every visitor’s to-do list and is one of the most frequented attractions
                in Moscow, it is important to arrive early to avoid queues, or at the very least limit the time you
                spend in one! The Kremlin opens at 10am and the ticket office opens an hour earlier – this is by far the
                best time to arrive and enjoy the Kremlin with less queues and crowds inside.The Kremlin may be geographically small, but it is condense and culturally enormous. I would recommend
                dedicating at least half a day to visiting the Kremlin, especially if you plan on entering the
                cathedrals and palaces inside.

               <b> functions like a typical central business district. In this area are concentrated most of the
            government offices and administrative headquarters of state bodies, most of the hotels and larger shops, and
            the principal theatres, museums, and art galleries. The inner city’s function as a residential area has not
            been completely lost, however; although many large prerevolution and Soviet-style apartment buildings were
            transformed into offices in the 1990s, some quiet residential neighbourhoods linger within the Garden Ring,
            mostly consisting of luxury apartments for Russia’s new elite.

            In the remainder of the central part of Moscow, within the Garden Ring, are buildings representative of
            every period of Moscow’s development from the 15th century to the present day. Scattered through the inner
            city are several fine examples of 17th-century church architecture, notably the Church of All Saints of
            Kulishki, built in the 1670s and ’80s to commemorate those killed in the Battle of Kulikovo (1380), and the
            Church of the Nativity of Putniki (1649–52). This was the period of development of the Moscow Baroque style;
            one of its best examples, located outside the city centre on the site of the former village of Fili, is the
            Church of the Intercession (1693). Buildings of the Classical period—beginning about the latter half of the
            18th century and covering the rebuilding of Moscow after the fire of 1812—abound within the Garden Ring and
            the Boulevard Ring (the latter forming a rough horseshoe north of the Moscow River around the Kremlin and
            Kitay-gorod) and in Zamoskvoreche, a largely residential district south of the river. Notable examples are
            the old university and the former meeting place of the assembly of nobles with its Hall of Columns (now the
            House of Trade Unions), both built by Matvei Kazakov in the 1780s; the elegant Pashkov House (1785–86), now
            part of the Russian State Library but still commonly referred to as the V.I. Lenin Library; the Lunin House
            (1818–23), now the Museum of Oriental Art; the Manezh (Riding School; 1817), which is now used as an
            exhibition hall; and the magnificent Bolshoi Theatre (1821–24), rebuilt in 1856 after a fire. Toward the end
            of the 19th century and continuing into the early 20th, buildings in the revivalist Old Russian style were
            built, including the Tretyakov Gallery (1906) and—just outside the Garden Ring—the Yaroslavl railway station
            (1902–04).

            
            In the Soviet period much more open space was created, especially by constructing large squares such as
            Manezhnaya.  At its outer end rises a lofty three-winged building overlooking the river, which
            for many years housed offices of Comecon (Council for Mutual Economic Assistance; disbanded in 1991) and now
            serves as the headquarters for the Moscow city government. Yet just next to this bustling thoroughfare is
            Arbat Prospekt (also called Old Arbat), one of the most picturesque streets of Moscow and now closed to
            vehicular traffic.
